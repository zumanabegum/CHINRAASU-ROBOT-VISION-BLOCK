🚀 Chinraasu & VisionBlocks – Empowering STEM Education
🔬 Bridging the gap between theory and practical learning in STEM!

📝 Overview
Chinraasu is an open-source, 3D-printable educational robot powered by Arduino Nano, designed to teach robotics, coding, and electronics through hands-on projects. Paired with VisionBlocks, an intuitive block-based coding IDE, this platform enables students to explore real-world product development from circuit design to software implementation.

🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional education focuses heavily on theory, with minimal exposure to practical applications. Students lack hands-on experience in electronics, CAD design, and software development, making it difficult to transition from concepts to real-world projects.

🔴 Challenges in STEM Education:

Limited hardware exposure in schools and colleges
Coding often taught as syntax memorization rather than real-world application
No end-to-end product development training (electronics → CAD → coding)
✅ Our Solution: Chinraasu + VisionBlocks provides a complete hands-on STEM learning experience by integrating:

Electronics & circuit connections through Arduino-based hardware
CAD design & 3D printing for custom robotics projects
No-code block programming for ease of learning
